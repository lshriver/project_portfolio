# project_portfolio

## 📜 Description 
A curated collection of projects demonstrating self-taught Python and data science skills -- with a special focus on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), computational biology, neuroscience modeling, and scientific simulation. This repository will serve as both a development portfolio and a hands on labaratory for creative problem-solving in STEM.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Project Planning and Sestup (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Preparation and Learning (Weeks 2-4)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Core Modules and Prototype (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Development and Learning Integration (Weeks 7-10)
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Application Building & Interactive Dashboard (Week 11-12)
- [ ] **Phase 6:** Polish, Feedback, and Future Proofing (Weeks 13-14)
