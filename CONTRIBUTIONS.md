## Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repository**
Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this repository to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
Clone your fork locally:

  ```
  BASH
  
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Project_Portfolio.git
  cd Project_Portfolio
  ```

3. **Setup Your Environment**
Ensure you have a Python virtual environment set up. For example:

  ```
  BASH
  
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions in several areas:

- **Learning Documentation:**
  Add or improve Wiki pages and documentation related to the learning phase. This includes tutorials, tips, and reflections on how you approached new topics like TensorFlow or PINNs.
- **Code Improvements:**
  Enhance the project code, add features, or fix bugs. Please adhere to the code style guidelines.
- **New Modules or Projects:**
  Propose or add new project modules that are in line with the portfolio's scope.
- **Examples and Tutorials:**
  Create Jupyter Notebooks or write blog-style tutorials that explain parts of the project, share the learning process, or demonstrate the use of specific techniques.
- **Issue Documentation:**
  Update or add documentation related to known issues and solutions, which is especially helpful in a learning-focused project.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter bugs or have ideas for improvements:

1. Search the issues page first.
2. If not found, create a new issue with a descriptive title and detailed description of the problem or suggestion.
3. Include relevant code samples or screenshots if applicable.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Write inline comments and docstrings to explain non-obvious parts of the code.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- If adding new Python modules or scripts, include tests where possible.

## Pull Request Process
1. Create a New Branch:
   Ensure your branch name reflects the feature or bug fix:
  
  ```
  BASH
  
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

2. Make Your Changes:
  Write code, tests, and documentation.
3. Commit Your Changes:
  Follow meaningful commit messages.
4. Push Your Branch:
   ```
   BASH
    
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
5. Submit a Pull Request:
  Open a pull request against the main branch. Your pull request should clearly describe the changes you made and any related issues.
